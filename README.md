# Deadlock Item Guesser
The **Deadlock Item Guesser** is a tool designed to help you quickly recognize in-game item icons, so you no longer have to hover over them. It allows you to test and improve your knowledge of item icons, all while having fun and learning to identify them instantly.

Simply open the [ItemGuesser.html](ItemGuesser.html) file to get started.

This little has been quickly put together and it may not look appropriate on all devices. Also it is currently only available in English, though I have left room for multilingual support. I have also left room for expansion with item attributes. Updates to this tool are not guaranteed.
